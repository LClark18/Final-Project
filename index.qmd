Hello my name is Logan Clark and I'm a 4th year here at Cal State University Fullerton and this is my final project for my Math 437: Modern Data Analysis class.

## Motivation and Context

For my project I decided to look at the sales of Video Games. Video Games have been my main hobby for most of my life and I've always had an innate interest in sales numbers. I would go on Wikipedia just to look at the list of best selling games and see what changes would be happening on the chart on a weekly basis. Each game would have it's own entry and show us what console it came out on, when it came out, etc. It makes me wonder if there's any common trends among games that have higher sales overall, such as if a specific genre is more appealing, or if games on a certain console did better than others.

## Main Objective

My main Objective for this project is to use clustering to see what games are similar and to see if we can see any patterns among games in the cluster that contains higher global sales.

### Data Limitations

The data only contains data until about 2016, so the data set itself is old and needs to be updated


## Data Wrangling (Optional Section)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Insights
