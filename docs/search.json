    "text": "Motivation and Context\nFor my project I decided to look at the sales of Video Games. Video Games have been my main hobby for most of my life and I’ve always had an innate interest in sales numbers. I would go on Wikipedia just to look at the list of best selling games and see what changes would be happening on the chart on a weekly basis. Each game would have it’s own entry and show us what console it came out on, when it came out, etc. It makes me wonder if there’s any common trends among games that have higher sales overall, such as if a specific genre is more appealing, or if games on a certain console did better than others."
